abstract = {We say that a vertex colouring {\$}\backslashvarphi{\$} of a graph {\$}G{\$} is nonrepetitive if there is no positive integer {\$}n{\$} and a path on {\$}2n{\$} vertices {\$}v{\_}{\{}1{\}}\backslashldots v{\_}{\{}2n{\}}{\$} in {\$}G{\$} such that the associated sequence of colours {\$}\backslashvarphi(v{\_}{\{}1{\}})\backslashldots\backslashvarphi(v{\_}{\{}2n{\}}){\$} satisfy {\$}\backslashvarphi(v{\_}{\{}i{\}})=\backslashvarphi(v{\_}{\{}i+n{\}}){\$} for all {\$}i=1,2,\backslashdots,n{\$}. The minimum number of colours in a nonrepetitive vertex colouring of {\$}G{\$} is the Thue chromatic number {\$}\backslashpi (G){\$}. For the case of vertex list colourings the Thue choice number {\$}\backslashpi{\_}{\{}l{\}}(G){\$} of {\$}G{\$} denotes the smallest integer {\$}k{\$} such that for every list assignment {\$}L:V(G)\backslashrightarrow 2{\^{}}{\{}\backslashmathbb{\{}N{\}}{\}}{\$} with minimum list length at least {\$}k{\$}, there is a nonrepetitive vertex colouring of {\$}G{\$} from the assigned lists. Recently it was proved that the Thue chromatic number and the Thue choice number of the same graph may have an arbitrary large difference in some classes of graphs. Here we give an overview of the known results where we compare these two parameters for several families of graphs and we also give a list of open problems on this topic.},

On the other hand, it is proved that if G′ is a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$, and G is obtained from G′ by attaching to each vertex v of G′ a connected graph of tree-depth at most z rooted at v, then $\pi$ch(G)≤c($\Delta$,z) for some constant c($\Delta$,d) depending only on $\Delta$ and z. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We determine the maximum density of a graph that admits a k-colouring that is nonrepetitive on paths. We prove that every graph has a subdivision that admits a 4-colouring that is nonrepetitive on paths. The best previous bound was 5. We also study colourings that are nonrepetitive on walks, and provide a conjecture that would imply that every graph with maximum degree Delta has a f(Delta)-colouring that is nonrepetitive on walks. We prove that every graph with treewidth k and maximum degree Delta has a O(kDelta)-colouring that is nonrepetitive on paths, and a O(kDelta 3)-colouring that is nonrepetitive on walks.},

abstract = {A sequence S = s1 s2 ... sn is said to be nonrepetitive if no two adjacent blocks of S are the same. A celebrated 1906 theorem of Thue asserts that there are arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequences over the set {\{} 0, 1, 2 {\}}. This result is the starting point of Combinatorics on Words-a wide area with many deep results, sophisticated methods, important applications and intriguing open problems. The main purpose of this survey is to present a range of new directions relating Thue sequences more closely to Graph Theory, Combinatorial Geometry, and Number Theory. For instance, one may consider graph colorings avoiding repetitions on paths, or colorings of points in the plane avoiding repetitions on straight lines. Besides presenting a variety of new challenges we also recall some older problems of this area. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A coloring of the vertices of a graph G is nonrepetitive if no path in G forms a sequence consisting of two identical blocks. The minimum number of colors needed is the Thue chromatic number, denoted by ?? (G). A famous theorem of Thue asserts that ?? (P) = 3 for any path P with at least four vertices. In this paper we study the Thue chromatic number of trees. In view of the fact that ?? (T) is bounded by 4 in this class we aim to describe the 4-chromatic trees. In particular, we study the 4-critical trees which are minimal with respect to this property. Though there are many trees T with ?? (T) = 4 we show that any of them has a sufficiently large subdivision H such that ?? (H) = 3. The proof relies on Thue sequences with additional properties involving palindromic words. We also investigate nonrepetitive edge colorings of trees. By a similar argument we prove that any tree has a subdivision which can be edge-colored by at most ?? + 1 colors without repetitions on paths. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the analogy between the polynomial-time hierarchy and the arithmetical hierarchy, the first order theory of equality plays the role of elementary arithmetic (as the ??-jump of the hierarchy).
