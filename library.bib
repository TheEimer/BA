@article{Grytczuk2008,
abstract = {A sequence S = s1 s2 ... sn is said to be nonrepetitive if no two adjacent blocks of S are the same. A celebrated 1906 theorem of Thue asserts that there are arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequences over the set {\{} 0, 1, 2 {\}}. This result is the starting point of Combinatorics on Words-a wide area with many deep results, sophisticated methods, important applications and intriguing open problems. The main purpose of this survey is to present a range of new directions relating Thue sequences more closely to Graph Theory, Combinatorial Geometry, and Number Theory. For instance, one may consider graph colorings avoiding repetitions on paths, or colorings of points in the plane avoiding repetitions on straight lines. Besides presenting a variety of new challenges we also recall some older problems of this area. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The polynomial-time hierarchy is that subrecursive analog of the Kleene arithmetical hierarchy in which deterministic (nondeterministic) polynomial time plays the role of recursive (recursively enumerable) time. Known properties of the polynomial-time hierarchy are summarized. A word problem which is complete in the second stage of the hierarchy is exhibited. In the analogy between the polynomial-time hierarchy and the arithmetical hierarchy, the first order theory of equality plays the role of elementary arithmetic (as the ??-jump of the hierarchy). The problem of deciding validity in the theory of equality is shown to be complete in polynomial-space, and close upper and lower bounds on the space complexity of this problem are established. ?? 1977.},

@article{Bresar2007,
abstract = {A coloring of the vertices of a graph G is nonrepetitive if no path in G forms a sequence consisting of two identical blocks. The minimum number of colors needed is the Thue chromatic number, denoted by ?? (G). A famous theorem of Thue asserts that ?? (P) = 3 for any path P with at least four vertices. In this paper we study the Thue chromatic number of trees. In view of the fact that ?? (T) is bounded by 4 in this class we aim to describe the 4-chromatic trees. In particular, we study the 4-critical trees which are minimal with respect to this property. Though there are many trees T with ?? (T) = 4 we show that any of them has a sufficiently large subdivision H such that ?? (H) = 3. The proof relies on Thue sequences with additional properties involving palindromic words. We also investigate nonrepetitive edge colorings of trees. By a similar argument we prove that any tree has a subdivision which can be edge-colored by at most ?? + 1 colors without repetitions on paths. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
